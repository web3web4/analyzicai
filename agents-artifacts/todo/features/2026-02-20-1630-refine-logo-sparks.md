# Refine Logo Sparks

**Date:** 2026-02-20

## Context
The "AI Spark" logo system (v2) has been approved for the AnalyzicAI family (AnalyzicAI, SolidicAI, UXicAI). The outer geometric containers (Data Apex, Code Core, Viewfinder) are finalized. The user requested to refine the central "AI Spark" (the 4-pointed purple star) inside the logos.

## Tasks
- [ ] Refine the central "AI Spark" inside the logos.
- [ ] Explore the alternative spark concepts generated in `archive/brand-and-logo/logos-preview-v2.html` (e.g., Sparkles, Constellation, Comet trail, Diamond core, Scattered).
- [ ] Ensure the refined spark scales well across all sizes (96px, 48px, 24px, and lockups).
- [ ] Once the spark is finalized, extract the final SVGs from the HTML preview and integrate them into the React components (e.g., `Footer.tsx`, `Navbar.tsx`).
